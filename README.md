# configs

Config files are managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). To symlink a group of configs use:

```
> stow -Sv <group>
```

## tools

- [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)
- [starship prompt](https://starship.rs/)
- [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) for symlinking configs
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for fuzzy searching
